	My name is Jax, I am a high school student and web developer. I started this business to help
	learn sales skills and be able to afford college. I learned how to code when I was 9 since I
	wanted to make games for my friends. Now after having coded for 7 years I am confident enough to
	charge for my work and have my method down to a science. <a class="font-semibold text-primary" href="/about">ABOUT US</a>
