			Giving Small Businesses The Big Business Treatment
		</h1>
		<p class="mt-7">
			My name is Jax Bulbrook, I am the owner and sole developer of Bulbrook Web Designs. I got into
			programming after dreaming for years about making my own video game. It eventually grew into a
			love of web development, and I realized I would enjoy working on websites much more than a
			traditional job. So over the course of two years I taught myself how to code websites the
			right way by hand and just started calling small businesses to offer my help.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-7">
			What I found was that a lot of small businesses don't have the funds to spend thousands of
			dollars upfront on a new website. For the few who did, they often were taken advantage of by
			bad web developers who look like they haven't seen design trends for decades. Then they can't
			get a refund and are stuck with a horrible website. That is why I decided to tweak my business model to fit
			their needs. You see the whole design process, and if you don't like the end product (even
			with unlimited edits!) you can always cancel free of charge.
