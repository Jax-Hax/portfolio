		<p  class="mt-7">
			My name is Jax B, I am the owner and sole developer of _______. I got into programming after
			dreaming for years about making my own video game. It eventually grew into a love of web
			development, and I realized I would enjoy working on websites much more than a traditional
			job. So over the course of two years I taught myself how to code websites the right way by
			hand and just started calling small businesses to offer my help.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-7">
			What I found was that a lot of small businesses don't have the funds to spend thousands of
			dollars upfront on a new website. And the ones that did, got taken advantage of and have a
			terrible website that looks like it was built by someone in a dungeon and haven't seen design
			trends for the last 10 years. They were in a frustrating spot - they either can't afford a
			good website, and if they can they don't know who to trust to make something great. So I
			tweaked my business model to fit their needs. That's how I came up with my $0 down and $150 a
			month model. It's more managable for a small business to handle and won't hurt their bank
			accounts.
